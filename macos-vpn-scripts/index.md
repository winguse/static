# MacOS VPN Script

Note: This script will not work with the VPN install by mobileconfig profile, so you need to create the VPN connection manually. And for the name of the VPN, please do not contain spaces or other special characters (say `(`).

Automatically split domestic (China Mainland) and international traffic:

1. Use the domestic DNS result from domestic DNS server and vice versa.
2. A dropdown menu to select different policies.

## Install

```sh
sudo sh -c "curl https://wingu.se/static/macos-vpn-scripts/install | sh"
```

And you can see a ðŸš¥ menu in your system tray when you connect to VPN.

## Uninstall

```sh
sudo rm /etc/ppp/ip-up /etc/ppp/ip-down /etc/ppp/cn-cidrs.txt /etc/ppp/another-dns /etc/ppp/static-dns-policy.txt /etc/ppp/another-dns.log /etc/ppp/dns-policy.txt
```
